Coding and hacking is our hobby and we want to share the joy with others. Web apps have full potential to help everyone learn coding anywhere anytime in the most fun way possible. This project is a humble approach to teach programming basics to beginners.

In MazeRunner, the goal is to program your character (Bleen) to get home safely! Code commands are simple and taught gradually to player thorough a series of 8 tutorials. Player will learn about commands, loops and code structures. Here is a quick list of available syntaxes:

To move use:
- Forward \<n\>
- Turn \<left/right\>
- wait \<n-steps\>

To create loops use:
- Label \<label-name\>
- Goto \<label-name\>
- Repeat \<n-times\> \<label-name\>

## Technical description

Levels can be easily created and added to the game. Levels are loaded as json objects and the game parses them to generate each level. The game is developed using Angular.js framework and html5/css3 tricks. 

## What tools we used?

- The mighty Koding IDE! we love how it helps us speed up our development
- Git/Github as code repo (obviously)
- Sublim as local editor
- Photoshop for art design
- GuarageBand for music
- Hipchat for our remote communication
- Beers, coffee and energy drink!
